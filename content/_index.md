Hello world!

I'm a soon-to-be graduate with a B.S in Computer Science and a minor in Cybersecurity. I've volunteered at SHELLCON 2018. Although I don't have much professional experience, I have worked on some freelance projects and I'm currently working on a capstone project with Enveron. 

I've been interested in computers from a young age, especially using them in a manner they weren't intended (I was that guy in middle school jailbreaking iPhones and I bought an R4DS so I could load up a third-party application (Yahoo messanger) to chat with my friend outside of class on my Nintendo DS.) Outside work, love hiking/backpacking, reading, cooking and Jiu-Jitsu.
